  abstract  = "Differentiation of inflammatory macrophages from monocytes is
               characterized by an orderly integration of epigenetic and
               transcriptional regulatory mechanisms guided by
               lineage-determining transcription factors such as PU.1. Further
               activation of macrophages leads to a stimulus- or
               microenvironment-specific signal integration with subsequent
               transcriptional control established by the action of tissue- or
               signal-associated transcription factors. Here, we assess four
               histone modifications during human macrophage activation and
               integrate this information with the gene expression data from 28
               different macrophage activation conditions in combination with
               GM-CSF. Bioinformatically, for inflammatory macrophages we
               define a unique network of transcriptional and epigenetic
               regulators (TRs), which was characterized by accessible
               promoters independent of the activation signal. In contrast to
               the general accessibility of promoters of TRs, mRNA expression
               of central TRs belonging to the TR network displayed
               stimulus-specific expression patterns, indicating a second level
               of transcriptional regulation beyond epigenetic chromatin
               changes. In contrast, stringent integration of epigenetic and
               transcriptional regulation was observed in networks of TRs
               established from somatic tissues and tissue macrophages. In
               these networks, clusters of TRs with permissive histone marks
               were associated with high gene expression whereas clusters with
               repressive chromatin marks were associated with absent gene
               expression. Collectively, these results support that macrophage
               activation during inflammation in contrast to lineage
               determination is mainly regulated transcriptionally by a
               pre-defined TR network.",
