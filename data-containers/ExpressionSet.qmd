```


The package Biobase contains standardized data structures to represent genomic data. The ExpressionSet class is designed to combine several different sources of information (i.e. as contained in the various MAGE-TAB files) into a single convenient structure. An ExpressionSet can be manipulated (e.g., subsetted, copied), and is the input to or output of many Bioconductor functions.

The data in `ExpressionSet` consist of:  

- `assayData`: Expression data from microarray experiments with microarray probes in rows and sample identifiers in columns.  

- `metaData`: 
  + `phenoData`: A description of the samples in the experiment with sample identifiers in rows and description elements in columns; holds the content of the SDRF file.  
  + `featureData`: metadata about the features on the chip.  
  + further annotations for the features, for example gene annotations from biomedical databases (annotation).  

- `ExperimentData`: A flexible structure to describe the experiment.  

The `ExpressionSet` class coordinates all of these data, so that one does not have to worry about the details. However, one should keep in mind that the rownames of the `phenoData` have to match the column names of the assay data, while the row names of the assay data have to match the row names of the `featureData`.  

You can use the functions `pData` and `fData` to extract the sample and feature annotation, respectively, from an `ExpressionSet`. The function `exprs` will return the expression data itself as a matrix.
