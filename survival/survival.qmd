# Overview
`Surv()`: a packaging function, like `I()` it doesn't transform its argument.
- `Surv(time, status)` - right censored data
- `Surv(time, endpoint == "death")` - right censored data, where the status variable is a character of factor.
- `Surv(t1, t2, status)` - counting process data
- `Surv(t1, ind, type=="left")` - left censoring
- `Surv(time, fstat)` - multiple stat data, fstat is a factor

`aareg`: Aalen's additive regression model.
- The `timereg` package is a much more comprehensive implementation of the Aalen model, so this document will say little about `aareg`.

`coxph()`: Cox's proportional harzards model.
- `coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ x, data = aml)` - standard Cox model.
