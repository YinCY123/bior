# H collection: hallmark gene sets
We envision this collection as the starting point for your exploration of the MSigDB resource and GSEA. Hallmark gene sets summarize and represent specific well-defined biological states or processes and display coherent expression. These gene sets were generated by a computational methodology based on identifying gene set overlaps and retaining genes that display coordinate expression. The hallmarks reduce noise and redundancy and provide a better delineated biological space for GSEA. We refer to the original overlapping gene sets, from which a hallmark is derived, as its 'founder' sets. Hallmark gene set pages provide links to the corresponding founder sets for deeper follow up.
