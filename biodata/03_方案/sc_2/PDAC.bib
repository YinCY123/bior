  abstract = "Pancreatic cancer is a common gastrointestinal malignancy, and is
              often associated with a poor prognosis. Challenges to effective
              screening for pancreatic cancer include low disease prevalence
              and high cost of screening modalities such as endoscopic
              ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging. Further, most patients
              are asymptomatic during the early course of disease, which often
              leads to delay in diagnosis. Treatment options include surgery,
              chemotherapy, and palliative care.",
