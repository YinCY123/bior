  abstract = "Pyroptosis and necroptosis are two recently identified forms of
              immunogenic cell death in the tumor microenvironment (TME),
              indicating a crucial involvement in tumor metastasis. However,
              the characteristics of necroptosis and pyroptosis that define
              tumor microenvironment and prognosis in ccRCC patients remain
              unknown. We systematically investigated the transcriptional
              variation and expression patterns of Necroptosis and Pyroptosis
              related genes (NPRGs). After screening the necroptosis-pyroptosis
              clusters, the potential functional annotation for clusters was
              explored by GSVA enrichment analysis. The Necroptosis-Pyroptosis
              Genes (NPG) scores were used for the prognosis model construction
              and validation. Then, the correlations of NPG score with clinical
              features, cancer stem cell (CSC) index, tumor mutation burden
              (TMB), TME, and Immune Checkpoint Genes (ICGs) were also
              individually explored to evaluate the prognosis predictive values
              in ccRCC. Microarray screenings identified 27 upregulated and 1
              downregulated NPRGs. Ten overall survival associated NPRGs were
              filtered to construct the NPG prognostic model indicating a
              better prognostic signature for ccRCC patients with lower NPG
              scores (P< 0.001), which was verified using the external cohort.
              Univariate and multivariate analyses along with Kaplan-Meier
              survival analysis demonstrated that NPG score prognostic model
              could be applied as an independent prognostic factor, and AUC
              values of nomogram from 1- to 5- year overall survival with good
              agreement in calibration plots suggested that the proposed
              prognostic signature possessed good predictive capabilities in
              ccRCC. A high-/sNPG score is proven to be connected with tumor
              growth and immune-related biological processes, according to
              enriched GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses. Comparing patients with a
              high-NPG score to those with a low-NPG score revealed significant
              differences in clinical characteristics, growth and recurrence of
              malignancies (CSC index), TME cell infiltration, and
              immunotherapeutic response (P< 0.005), potentially making the NPG
              score multifunctional in the clinical therapeutic setting.
              Furthermore, AIM2, CASP4, GSDMB, NOD2, and RBCK1 were also found
              to be highly expressed in ccRCC cell lines and tumor tissues, and
              GASP4 and GSDMB promote ccRCC cells' proliferation, migration,
              and invasion. This study firstly suggests that targeting the NPG
              score feature for TME characterization may lend novel insights
              into its clinical applications in the prognostic prediction of
              ccRCC.",

              histological and devastating subtype of renal cell carcinoma.
              Necroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that causes
              prominent inflammatory responses. miRNAs play a significant role
              in cancer progression through necroptosis. However, the
              prognostic value of necroptosis-related miRNAs remains ambiguous.
              In this study, 39 necroptosis-related miRNAs (NRMs) were
              extracted and 17 differentially expressed NRMs between normal and
              tumor samples were identified using data form The Cancer Genome
              Atlas (TCGA). After applying univariate Cox proportional hazard
              regression analysis and LASSO Cox regression model, six
              necroptosis-related miRNA signatures were identified in the
              training cohort and their expression levels were verified by
              qRT-PCR. Using the expression levels of these miRNAs, all
              patients were divided into the high- and low-risk groups.
              Patients in the high-risk group showed poor overall survival (P <
              0.0001). Time-dependent ROC curves confirmed the good performance
              of our signature. The results were verified in the testing cohort
              and the entire TCGA cohort. Univariate and multivariate Cox
              regression models demonstrated that the risk score was an
              independent prognostic factor. Additionally, a predictive
              nomogram with good performance was constructed to enhance the
              implementation of the constructed signature in a clinical
              setting. We then employed miRBD, miRTarBase, and TargetScan to
              predict the target genes of six necroptosis-related miRNAs. Gene
              ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses
              indicated that 392 potential target genes were enriched in cell
              proliferation-related biological processes. Six miRNAs and 59
              differentially expressed target genes were used to construct an
              miRNA-mRNA interaction network, and 11 hub genes were selected
              for survival and tumor infiltration analysis. Drug sensitivity
              analysis revealed potential drugs that may contribute to cancer
              management. Hence, necroptosis-related genes play an important
              role in cancer biology. We developed, for the first time, a
              necroptosis-related miRNA signature to predict ccRCC prognosis.",
