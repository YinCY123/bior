# CPM
counts per million(single-end sequencing)

$$CPM = \frac{R_{g}}{D * L_{g}} * 10^6$$

$r_{g}$: read counts for gene g.  
$D$: total mapped reads for this sample.  
$L_{g}$: gene length for gene g.  



# TPM 
transcript per million(pair-end sequencing).

$$TPM = \frac{F_{g}}{D * L_{g}} * 10^6$$
$F_{g}$: mapped reads for gene g.  
$D$: total mapped reads of this sample.  
$L_{g}$: gene length of gene g (kilobase).
