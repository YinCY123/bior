# RPKM
RPKM(reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped).  

$$RPKM \space or \space FPKM = \frac{R_{g}}{D * L_{g}} * 10^6$$

$R_{g}$: read counts for gene g. 
$D$: total mapped reads of this sample. 
$L_{g}$: gene length (kilobase). 



# FPKM
FPKM(fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped). 

$$FPKM = \frac{F_{g}}{D * L_{g}}$$

$F_{g}$: fragments mapped to gene g.  
$D$: total mapped reads of this sample.  
$L_{g}$: gene length of gene g.
