  abstract  = "The proto-oncogene KRAS is mutated in a wide array of human
               cancers, most of which are aggressive and respond poorly to
               standard therapies. Although the identification of specific
               oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective,
               molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained
               refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for
               targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when
               inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an
               oncogenic allele. Here we have used systematic RNA interference
               to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found
               that the non-canonical IkappaB kinase TBK1 was selectively
               essential in cells that contain mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1
               induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that
               depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1
               activated NF-kappaB anti-apoptotic signals involving c-Rel and
               BCL-XL (also known as BCL2L1) that were essential for survival,
               providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal
               interaction. These observations indicate that TBK1 and NF-kappaB
               signalling are essential in KRAS mutant tumours, and establish a
               general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent
               pathways in cancer.",
