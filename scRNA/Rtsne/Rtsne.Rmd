There are mainly two functions in this package:  
- `normalize_input`: centers each column of an input matrix so that it has a mean of zero. Scales the entire matrix so that the largest absolute of the centered matrix is equal to unity.  

- `Rtsne`: the main working horse in this package for computing  a low dimensional embedding of high-dimensional data.  

```{r}
library(Rtsne)
library(magrittr)

out <- Rtsne(X = iris_matrix, 
             is_distance = F, 
             theta = 0.2, 
             perplexity = 20, 
             pca = TRUE, 
             pca_scale = TRUE, 
             initial_dims = 3)
out$Y %>% plot(pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
```
